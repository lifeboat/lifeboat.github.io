{"name":"The Lifeboat Foundation ~ Collaborations on Github","tagline":"The Lifeboat Foundation","body":"### The Lifeboat Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Lifeboat Foundation is developing a Github presence in order to facilitate content development and idea generation. In this Github space, Advisory Board members can generate repositories or reference repositories of their own, collaborate with others across Github, and jointly develop content which may appear from time to time at [lifeboat.com](http://lifeboat.com).\r\n\r\n## Mission Statement\r\n\r\n> The Lifeboat Foundation is a nonprofit nongovernmental organization dedicated to encouraging scientific advancements while helping humanity survive [existential risks](http://lifeboat.com/ex/programs) and possible misuse of increasingly powerful technologies, including genetic engineering, nanotechnology, and robotics/AI, as we move towards the [Singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity).\r\n \r\nLifeboat Foundation is pursuing a variety of options, including helping to accelerate the development of technologies to defend humanity, including new [methods to combat viruses](http://lifeboat.com/ex/bio.shield) (such as RNA interference and new vaccine methods), effective [nanotechnological defensive strategies](http://lifeboat.com/ex/nano.shield), and even self-sustaining [space colonies](http://lifeboat.com/ex/ark_i) in case the other defensive strategies fail.\r\n \r\nWe believe that, in some situations, it might be feasible to relinquish technological capacity in the public interest (for example, we are against the U.S. government posting the recipe for the 1918 flu virus on the internet). We have some of the best minds on the planet working on [programs](http://lifeboat.com/ex/programs) to enable our survival. We [invite](http://lifeboat.com/docs/invitation.doc) you to join our cause!\r\n \r\nThe Lifeboat Foundation now has the worldâ€™s first bitcoin endowment fund at [https://lifeboat.com/ex/bitcoin](https://lifeboat.com/ex/bitcoin).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
